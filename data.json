Use the mouse to look around, the WASD keys to move, and click and drag inside the window to control how strong the black hole is. At first, you will only see a sphere; this is not the black hole, which is actually at first between you and the sphere and starts at zero strength. This project is written in Processing.",

Particles with a temperature above zero will tend to repel other particles and those with a temperature below zero will try to stick to other particles.
